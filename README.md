## Catalogue of Recipes

In this project, I built a fast and dynamic catalogue of recipes using react/redux, axios, promises etc.
- `Recipes page` with a list of recipes that could be filtered by some parameters; in this project, it's a list of recipes that can be filtered by ingredients (shrimp, broccoli, etc.)
- `Recipe details page` for the recipe details; in this example, the recipe detail page (Preview Recipe)
